# Flight-Computer

This is for a water-powered rocket and I wanted to add a small flight computer in there to be able to measure data like altitude and gyro/accel data for all 3 axis. I had a small esp8266 module some bmp180 modules, and a mpu6050 from another project so I decided to use those parts for this. to increase speed and data processing I am storing all the data as a CSV on an SD card connected to the esp8266.
