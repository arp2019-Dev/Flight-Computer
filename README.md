# Flight-Computer

This is for a water powered rocket and i wanted to add a small flight computer in there to be able to measure data like altitude and gyro/accel data for all 3 axis. I had a samll esp8266 module and some bmp180 modules, and a mpu6050 from another project so decided to use those parts for this. to increase speed and data processing i am storing all the data as a csv on an sd card connected to the esp8266.
